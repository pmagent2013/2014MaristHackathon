Welcome to the Int-Elligence Note System!
<br>
This is a system designed to allow you to upload your class notes.
<br>
Using the Upload Note tab you can add a picture of your notes.
<br>
If the picture was taking during your class time it will automatically upload to that classes directory.
<br>
Using the my notes tab, you can view the notes sorted by class.
